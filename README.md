# Foveated-Encoder-for-VR
Foveated imaging is a digital image processing technique in which the image resolution, or amount of detail, varies across the image according to one or more "fixation points." A fixation point indicates the highest resolution region of the image and corresponds to the center of the eye's retina, the fovea. This project is built for the Oculus as a renderer, helping reduce file sizes dramatically. 
Add the libraries as needed, plug in your rift and watch the world get compressed, effecient and render better.
